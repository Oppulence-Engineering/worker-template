- Target Release: Q1–Q2 2025

## Summary
This RFC proposes a roadmap of job orchestration capabilities for the Graphile Worker template. The aim is to elevate the template from a thin starter kit into a production-ready job platform. The proposal clusters features into three priority bands—high, medium, and advanced—so we can stage delivery, align cross-functional stakeholders, and implement incremental value safely.

## Background & Motivation
The existing template focuses on the essentials of Graphile Worker: job definition, execution, and observability hooks. As teams scale usage, they repeatedly bolt on similar infrastructure for scheduling, fault isolation, orchestration, and governance. Providing these features as first-class modules reduces time-to-value, ensures consistent quality, and positions the template as a reference implementation for complex job processing workloads.

### Pain Points Observed
- Lack of native time-based scheduling drives teams to maintain sidecars or external cron jobs.
- Permanent job failures are hard to triage without a dedicated dead-letter workflow.
- Multi-step business processes require bespoke orchestration logic and manual rollback handling.
- Tenants, rate limits, and feature flags introduce cross-cutting concerns that are expensive to retrofit.
- Observability tooling (dashboards, admin UI) is typically rebuilt per project.

## Goals
- Deliver a cohesive suite of job platform capabilities that can be enabled progressively.
- Maintain ergonomic APIs that feel idiomatic to Graphile Worker.
- Provide extensible hooks so teams can customize behaviour without forking the template.
- Document operational guardrails and testing strategies for each feature.

## Non-Goals
- Replace Graphile Worker with a bespoke queueing engine.
- Support every cloud provider or infrastructure combination.
- Provide a full SaaS control plane (billing, tenant onboarding, etc.).

## Success Metrics
- Time to enable scheduling and DLQ features reduced by >50% compared to ad-hoc implementations.
- Adoption of at least 3 high-priority features by two reference projects within one quarter.
- Reduction in incident count tied to job orchestration defects (qualitative feedback).

## Detailed Proposals (High Priority)

### 1. Job Scheduling & Cron Support
**Motivation:** Teams repeatedly wire external cron schedulers to enqueue jobs. This adds infrastructure overhead, complicates deployments, and fragments job configuration. An in-template scheduler makes time-driven workloads a first-class citizen while preserving Graphile Worker’s reliability guarantees.

**Architecture Overview**
- `ScheduledJobDefinition<TSchema extends z.ZodTypeAny, TResult>` describes each recurring job with cron syntax, optional timezone, payload schema, and an asynchronous handler returning `TResult`.
- A `schedulerRegistry` module exports an immutable array of definitions. The worker bootstrap reconciles registry entries against `graphile_worker.crontab`, ensuring idempotent upserts so deployments never double-register jobs.
- A `ScheduleReconciler` background job monitors drift, emits metrics, and heals missing entries (for example after manual DB intervention).
- One-off jobs share the same validation path via `scheduleOnce<TSchema>` helper functions that convert declarative requests into calls to `addJob` with proper `runAt`, `priority`, and `job_key` handling.

**Type-Safe API Surface**
```ts
import { addJob } from "graphile-worker";
import { z } from "zod";

export interface ScheduledJobDefinition<
  TPayloadSchema extends z.ZodTypeAny,
  TResult
> {
  key: string;
  cron: string;
  timezone?: string;
  payloadSchema: TPayloadSchema;
  handler: (
    payload: z.infer<TPayloadSchema>,
    context: SchedulerContext
  ) => Promise<TResult>;
  onSuccess?: (
    result: TResult,
    context: SchedulerContext
  ) => Promise<void>;
}

export const nightlyReportPayload = z.object({
  reportDate: z.string().datetime({ offset: true }),
  notifyEmails: z.array(z.string().email()).default([]),
});

export const nightlyReportJob: ScheduledJobDefinition<
  typeof nightlyReportPayload,
  void
> = {
  key: "nightly-report",
  cron: "0 2 * * *",
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  payloadSchema: nightlyReportPayload,
  handler: async ({ reportDate, notifyEmails }, { logger }) => {
    const report = await generateReport({ reportDate });
    await deliverReport({ report, notifyEmails, logger });
  },
};

export async function scheduleOnce<
  TPayloadSchema extends z.ZodTypeAny,
  TResult
>(
  definition: ScheduledJobDefinition<TPayloadSchema, TResult>,
  payload: z.input<TPayloadSchema>,
  options: { runAt?: Date; priority?: number; jobKey?: string } = {}
) {
  const validatedPayload = definition.payloadSchema.parse(payload);
  await addJob(definition.key, validatedPayload, options);
}
```
The combination of generics and Zod keeps runtime validation and compile-time inference aligned, eliminating the need for unsafe casts and surfacing payload schema drift during development.

**Persistence & Deployment Integration**
- Schedules persist inside Postgres using Graphile Worker’s `graphile_worker.crontab`. The reconciler performs `insert ... on conflict` operations keyed by `task_identifier`.
- Helm values expose a `scheduler.definitions` section enabling infrastructure teams to override cron strings, timezones, or disable jobs per environment without code changes.
- Optional companion table (`app.scheduled_job_events`) stores historical runs for auditing and drift analysis:
```sql
create table if not exists app.scheduled_job_events (
  id bigserial primary key,
  job_key text not null,
  scheduled_at timestamptz not null,
  started_at timestamptz,
  completed_at timestamptz,
  status text not null check (status in ('scheduled','started','succeeded','failed')),
  error jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**Implementation Sketch**
1. Extend the worker bootstrap to load `schedulerRegistry` definitions, validate cron expressions via `cron-validator`, and reconcile entries inside a single transaction.
2. Implement `ScheduleReconciler` to compare desired vs. actual schedule metadata, logging and emitting metrics when differences occur.
3. Wire timezone normalization through `Intl.DateTimeFormat` (or `luxon`) so cron evaluation uses deterministic offsets even during DST transitions.
4. Provide CLI tooling (`yarn worker:schedule:list`) that prints registry entries, next run times, and any validation warnings to aid operators.

**Testing & Observability**
- Unit tests cover cron validation failures, timezone normalization, and registry reconciliation idempotency.
- Contract tests ensure `scheduleOnce` enqueues jobs with the same payload shape that the handler expects by asserting successful Zod parsing.
- Metrics: `scheduler_next_run_timestamp{job_key}`, `scheduler_missed_total{job_key}`, `scheduler_drift_seconds{job_key}`, `scheduler_validation_errors_total`.
- Structured logs include correlation IDs so a missed schedule can be traced from reconcilers to handler execution.

**Risks / Mitigations**
- _Risk:_ Double scheduling during deploys. _Mitigation:_ Reconciler uses deterministic upsert keyed by `task_identifier` and deletes orphaned entries when definitions are removed.
- _Risk:_ Timezone drift or DST surprises. _Mitigation:_ Enforce UTC default while requiring explicit `timezone`; add smoke tests for DST boundaries.
- _Risk:_ Invalid cron expressions shipped to production. _Mitigation:_ Fail fast during application bootstrap with actionable error messages and pre-deploy lint checks.

**Open Questions**
- Should schedule definitions live purely in code, or can we support remote configuration sources (for example ConfigMaps) without adding brittleness?
- Do we support calendar-based schedules (business days, fiscal calendars) in v1 or rely on follow-up modules?
- How should we surface reconciliation actions to operators—logs only, or a dedicated dashboard row in the planned admin UI?

### 2. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Pattern
**Motivation:** Graphile Worker retries jobs but lacks an opinionated path for quarantining permanently failed work. Teams need a managed DLQ to inspect, reprocess, or discard jobs without manual SQL.

**Proposal:**
- Introduce a `DLQManager` service with configuration for enabling, maximum retries, and custom handlers.
- On exceeding `maxRetries`, move job payload, metadata, and failure context into a DLQ table (`graphile_worker_dlq`).
- Provide admin utilities to requeue jobs (with new metadata), bulk clear, or export for analysis.
- Emit events/hooks for automated incident response (PagerDuty, Slack, etc.).

**Implementation Sketch:**
1. Extend job runner to call `DLQManager.moveToDeadLetter` when `attempts >= maxRetries`.
2. Store original payload, error stack, timestamps, and job tags to support filtering.
3. Ship TypeScript helpers (`reprocessDLQ`, `inspectDLQ`) and CLI commands (`yarn worker:dlq:list`).

**Testing & Observability:**
- Integration tests covering retry exhaustion and DLQ insertion.
- Metrics: `dlq_jobs_total`, `dlq_reprocessed_total`, `dlq_age_seconds`.

**Risks / Mitigations:**
- _Risk:_ DLQ table growth. _Mitigation:_ Provide TTL policies and archival hooks.
- _Risk:_ Reprocessing loops. _Mitigation:_ Track requeue attempts, enforce exponential backoff.

**Open Questions:**
- Should DLQ entries inherit original priorities when reprocessed?
- Do we need per-job-type DLQ policies in v1?

### 3. Job Workflows & Chaining
**Motivation:** Complex business flows require multi-step orchestration with compensation. Native support reduces bespoke saga implementations and encourages consistency.

**Proposal:**
- Add a `WorkflowJob<TSteps>` abstraction with ordered `steps`, each implementing `execute` and optional `compensate`.
- Support dependency graphs via `addJob(..., { dependencies: [...] })` to gate job execution until prerequisites finish successfully.
- Provide observers for workflow state transitions (pending, in-progress, compensated, failed).
- Consider persisting workflow state in a dedicated table to support visualization and recovery.

**Implementation Sketch:**
1. Define a step interface with id, execute, compensate, and metadata.
2. Extend job runner to enforce dependencies using Graphile Worker job queues or separate `workflow_execution` store.
3. Provide helper to emit structured events for UI and logging.

**Testing & Observability:**
- Unit tests mocking step execution success/fail paths.
- Scenario tests for compensation triggers and idempotency.
- Metrics: `workflow_duration_seconds`, `workflow_compensation_total`.

**Risks / Mitigations:**
- _Risk:_ Partial failure without compensation. _Mitigation:_ Require idempotent `compensate` and provide templates.
- _Risk:_ Dependency deadlocks. _Mitigation:_ Validate acyclic dependency graphs at registration time.

**Open Questions:**
- How do we visualize workflows (UI integration, Graphviz export)?
- Should compensation be optional vs. mandatory?

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
**Motivation:** Protection against downstream overload and shared resource contention is critical for reliable operations, especially in multi-tenant contexts.

**Proposal:**
- Introduce `RateLimitedJob` with declarative limits (`maxConcurrent`, `maxPerSecond`, `maxPerMinute`, `burstSize`).
- Offer a `TenantRateLimiter` service to enforce per-tenant quotas using Redis or Postgres advisory locks.
- Provide instrumentation to surface throttle events and backlog length.

**Implementation Sketch:**
1. Wrap job execution with token bucket / leaky bucket algorithm.
2. Persist counters in Redis or Postgres depending on deployment footprint; default to Postgres to avoid extra infra.
3. Provide middleware to short-circuit job execution when limits breach, requeuing with delay.

**Testing & Observability:**
- Stress tests simulating high concurrency.
- Metrics: `job_throttled_total`, `rate_limit_backlog_size`, `tenant_quota_exceeded_total`.

**Risks / Mitigations:**
- _Risk:_ Central limiter becomes bottleneck. _Mitigation:_ Support sharding or pluggable backend.
- _Risk:_ Rate limit misconfiguration blocks critical jobs. _Mitigation:_ Provide dry-run / alert-only mode.

**Open Questions:**
- Which backend should be default (Redis vs. Postgres)?
- How do we expose configuration via Helm charts?

### 5. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Motivation:** External dependencies may degrade. A circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by halting execution until recovery criteria are met.

**Proposal:**
- Introduce `CircuitBreakerJob` configuration (`enabled`, `failureThreshold`, `resetTimeout`, `halfOpenRequests`).
- Maintain breaker state per job type or per downstream service.
- Expose metrics and alerting for open/half-open states.

**Implementation Sketch:**
1. Implement a state machine (closed → open → half-open → closed) stored in Redis/Postgres.
2. Wrap job execution to record success/failure, adjusting breaker state accordingly.
3. Allow overriding breaker behaviour (force open/closed) via admin tools.

**Testing & Observability:**
- Unit tests covering state transitions.
- Chaos testing by simulating downstream failures.
- Metrics: `circuit_state{state}`, `circuit_half_open_trials_total`.

**Risks / Mitigations:**
- _Risk:_ Breaker stuck open causing work backlog. _Mitigation:_ Provide manual override and alerts.
- _Risk:_ Per-job breaker configuration proliferation. _Mitigation:_ Encourage shared breaker instances keyed by dependency.

**Open Questions:**
- Should breaker metrics integrate with existing alerting via Prometheus rules?
- How do we handle jobs that must always attempt execution (override breaker)?

## Delivery Strategy

### Phased Roadmap
1. **Milestone 1 (Q1 2025):** Scheduling, DLQ, Workflow, Rate Limiting, Circuit Breaker.
2. **Milestone 2 (Q2 2025):** Deduplication, Grafana dashboards, Admin UI integration, Webhooks.
3. **Milestone 3 (H2 2025):** Versioning, Multi-tenancy, Feature flags, Distributed locking, Priority queues, SLO monitoring.

### Cross-Cutting Tasks
- Documentation updates (developer guide, ops handbook, Helm charts).
- Testing harness expansion (integration tests, load tests).
- Observability alignment (metrics naming, dashboards, alerts).
- Security review for admin UI and webhook endpoints.

## Dependencies & Compatibility
- Relies on Graphile Worker >= 0.14 for cron enhancements.
- Optional Redis dependency for rate limiting / locking (fallback to Postgres).
- Helm charts must expose configuration for enabling/disabling each feature.
- Grafana dashboards require Prometheus metrics pipeline.

## Operational Considerations
- Provide migration scripts for new tables (DLQ, workflow state, schedule registry).
- Document backup/restore guidance for DLQ and workflow tables.
- Ensure components remain backwards compatible when features disabled.
- Encourage feature flags or environment variables to stage rollout.

## Risks & Open Questions
- Balancing configurability vs. complexity: how do we avoid overwhelming new users?
- Ensuring minimal overhead when features are disabled (zero-cost abstractions).
- Potential need for upgrade tooling to migrate existing projects using the template.
- Licensing of third-party UI components (if bundling Graphile Worker Admin).
